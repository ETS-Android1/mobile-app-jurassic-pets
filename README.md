Java Mobile App

Jurassic Pets is a mobile application catered for children. The user chooses a virtual pet which they level up by the number of steps they take per day. 
The user can then use a shop to buy items for their pet.

This application was built in Android Studio using Java, for the front-end it uses XML and I've started to build the database for it using SQLite.
